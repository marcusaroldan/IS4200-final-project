Concern-\ning the retraining policy, a review in the context of PPC \nreporting common practices, advantages and pitfalls \nseems to be missing in the scientific literature.\n2.\t Improve the integration between the PPC, logistics, and \ndesign: it was stated that the PPC benefits from different \nuse cases. However, recent literature seems to overlook \nlogistics as well as product and process design applica-\ntions coupled with the PPC. To tackle this challenge, \nit is necessary enable data availability, continuity and \nsharing over the design, logistics, and production depart-\nments. This could be achieved through interoperability \nas well as communication of intra-organizational sys-\ntems such as the PLM, ERP, and MES. Even if projects \nthat are meant to couple such systems are costly, they \nare necessary to ensure data availability and quality. One \nway to achieve this is the use of data lakes, which have \nbeen recognized as suitable to handle big data reposito-\nries of a structured and unstructured nature (Llave 2018; \nLo Giudice et\u00a0al. 2019). For instance, Llave (2018) con-\ncluded, through expert interviews, that one of the key \npurposes of data lakes is to serve as experimentation \nplatforms for data scientists.\n3.\t Set human interaction and environmental aspect as pri-\norities to ensure the development of ethical manufactur-\ning in I4.0: exploring the interaction of humans with \nthe proposed ML-PPC models is paramount to build-\ning inclusive technologies at the service of society. To \nachieve this, the short- and long-term impact of ML-\nPPC systems on employees\u2019 working conditions must \nbe assessed. If the system degrades them, it must be \nredesigned. Concerning the second aspect, seeking a \nreduction in the environmental impact of manufactur-\ning through ML could provide important developments. \nThis can be addressed from a purely PPC approach by \noptimizing, for instance, the scheduling of disassembly \nprocesses or by improving the prediction of production \ntimes to avoid energy waste. Other approaches could \nbe the optimization of the supply chain. Even though \nthe supply chain was not covered in this review, it is an \nappropriate domain for researchers to implement ML \napplications. For instance, by considering environmental \ncriteria when choosing suppliers, as in (Hosseini and \nBarker 2016).\nSome of the research gaps indicated in this review could \nmotivate future work. Future work will be focused on the \nfollowing aspects:\n1.\t The proposed activities will be reviewed to determine \nan order between them, creating a procedure: this would \nhelp shift from a linear to a circular workflow when \nimplementing ML-PPC models.\n2.\t The most suitable techniques and tools will be linked to \neach of the activities with sectorial information: linking \ntechniques, tools, and activities is the key to creating \ngood practices that could be helpful to new practitioners, \nboth in research and industry. Furthermore, according to \nKusiak (2017, 2019), there are profound differences in \nthe volume of data generation and usage across different \nindustries. Therefore, future work will aim to identify \ntrends categorized by sectorial information.\n3.\t The current state of data availability solutions and work-\narounds will be explored: as data availability was found \nto be a main issue, a review of techniques to tackle the \nclass-imbalance problem and the use of transfer learning \nin the context of PPC will be performed. Additionally, \nthe utilization of data lakes for ML-PPC will also be \nexplored.\n4.\t Future research avenues will be proposed through an \nNLP analysis: NLP may enable the discovery of non-\ntrivial trends present in the corpus of the 93 sampled \narticles. This will complement the results of the system-\natic literature review.\nAcknowledgements\u2002 This work was financially supported by a part-\nnership between the company iFAKT France SAS and the ANRT \n(Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie) under \nthe Grant 2018/1266.

Furthermore, 24 (43%) \ndomains lie in the range of 1 to 3 papers. This means that \nnearly half of the domains are in an exploration phase. These \ntwo remarks lead to conclude that ML-PPC in the I4.0 is still \nan active research topic with strong perspectives.\nFrom Fig.\u00a013, it can be said that there is a strong trend of \nusing multiple synergies between learning types across all \nof the different use cases. However, there are no applications \nof RL in Time Estimation and in Smart Design of Products \nand Processes. The reason for this may be that these use \ncases have strong strategic impacts. Therefore, current ML \nimplementations in such applications aim to support deci-\nsions rather than automating them such as with agent-based \nsystems driven by RL.\nThere are two use cases achieving a high maturity: Smart \nPlanning and Scheduling and Process Control and Moni-\ntoring. They both cover all but one of the characteristics \nof I4.0. In the case of Smart Planning and Scheduling, it \nfails to address the Self-Execution of Resources and Pro-\ncesses, which suggests that there are research perspectives \nin coupling the production planning and scheduling with \nautonomous physical resources. For the Process Control \nand Monitoring, there is a lack of applications satisfying \nthe Customer-Centric Product Development, which would \nbe an automatic optimization of physical resources from the \nanalysis of customer-related variables.\nKnowledge Discovery and Generation is the only char-\nacteristic addressed by all the use cases, which denotes an \nintense interest in knowledge creation from data. Further-\nmore, there is a strong presence of SL, UL, and SL-UL \nin this characteristic. This implies an important affinity \nbetween these learning types and the generation of useful \ninformation from raw data. Following a similar trend, there \nseems to be a generalized interest in Environment-Centric \nProcesses, a characteristic that is addressed by almost all of \nthe use cases. However, its low number of papers implies \nthat there are strong research avenues to be explored.\nCommunications addressing the Self-Execution of \nResources and Processes focused exclusively on Process \nControl and Monitoring applications. This shows that \nthe dynamic optimization of working parameters of the \nmachines allows data-driven intelligent resources to be \ncreated. However, this characteristic has further potential \nto be explored in PPC research with other use cases, such \nas in Inventory and Distribution Control with autonomous \nAGVs to serve logistic needs or in quality, by automating \nprocesses.\nConclusion and\u00a0further research \nperspectives\nThis state-of-the-art analysis studied 93 research articles \nchosen through the logic of a systematic literature review. \nThese papers were analyzed by means of an analytical \nframework composed of four axes. First, the elements of a \nmethod were reviewed, which enabled an analysis of activi-\nties, techniques, and tools to perform a ML-PPC. Secondly, \nthe data sources employed to implement a ML-PPC model \nwere recognized and assessed. Thirdly, an analysis of the \nuse cases enabled the recognition of the applications of \ndata-driven models in the 4.0. Fourthly, the characteristics \nof I4.0 were identified and assessed through their usage. \nAdditionally, a mapping of the scientific literature was pro-\nposed by means of the use cases, characteristics of I4.0 and \nML learning types.\nResults concerning the activities allowed the recogni-\ntion of eleven recurrent tasks that are employed to create a \nML-PPC model. They were grouped in four clusters follow-\ning their use percentage: CUAs (Commonly Used Activi-\nties), OUAs (Often Used Activities), MUAs (Medium Use \nActivities), and SUAs (Seldom Use Activities). From these \nclusters, it can be concluded that activities belonging to the \nCUAs and OUAs clusters are well documented in the scien-\ntific literature. MUAs activities mainly contain data pre-pro-\ncessing tasks, which are necessary but not commonly docu-\nmented by researchers. Finally, the SUAs cluster suggests \nthat there are three activities rarely addressed in literature: \nthe design and implementation of data acquisition methods \nfrom the manufacturing system, the exploration of data to \nget insights, and the constant adaptation of the proposed \nML-PPC model to the environment dynamics.\nAn extensive review of the techniques identified the most \nused families in scientific literature. These were found to \nbe the NN, Q-Learning, DT, Clustering, Regression, and \nEnsemble learning. From these results, a temporal evolu-\ntion analysis of the top 6 most used families was performed. \nFindings suggested a growing interest in NN and Ensemble \nlearning, which motivated a focused study on the detailed \ntechniques encompassed by these families. Concerning the \nNN, the Multi-layer perceptron was the most used technique. \nNevertheless, more specialized deep learning techniques \nsuch as CNNs, LSTMs, and Deep Belief Networks are \n", []], "Cross-axes analysis: mapping the\u00a0scientific literature through\u00a0use cases, I4.0 characteristics, and\u00a0learning types": ["1547\nJournal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1531\u20131558\t\n1 3\npapers), as well as the Knowledge Discovery and Genera-\ntion (26 papers) appear to be moderately boarded. This leads \nto two main conclusions: first, ML-PPC models effectively \nendow manufacturing systems with the capacity of adapting \nto unexpected events and predicting production problems. \nThis is suitable to handle the stochastic nature of production \nenvironments. Secondly, ML is suitable to generate knowl-\nedge from PPC data, which is crucial in I4.0, where data is \nabundant, and it can provide useful guidelines to improve \nthe company\u2019s know-how.\nFour characteristics were rarely satisfied: The Customer-\nCentric Product Development (3 papers), the Self-Execution \nof Resources and Processes (4 papers), the Smart Human \nInteraction (7 papers), and the Environment-Centric Pro-\ncesses (8 papers), which points to strong research perspec-\ntives of ML-PPC applications enabling these features. Con-\ncerning the Customer-Centric Product Development, it was \nrare to find papers including customer-related variables into \ntheir PPC. This can be due to the difficulty to access data \nfrom customers or end users. For instance, as observed in \nthe data sources section, user data was seldom employed.\nThe low number of papers dealing with Self-Execution \nof Resources and Processes suggests that it is unusual to \ncouple the PPC with autonomous physical resources. This \ncan be due to the complexity of such systems as they require \nimportant capital investments as well as multi-disciplinary \nknowledge in production systems, mechatronics, and control \ntheory.\nIt was very surprising to find that the Smart Human \nInteraction (7 papers) and the Environment-Centric Pro-\ncesses (8 papers) are rarely addressed. Indeed, manufactur-\ning systems can be human based in several steps such as \nduring the execution in the shop floor or during the tactical \nplanning definition. Not considering the interaction of the \nproposed ML-PPC models with humans can be harmful for \nthe deployment of the proposed system, as it may worsen \nthe working conditions. Therefore, thinking about this \nhuman-ML interaction is the cornerstone for a successful \nadoption. Concerning the Environment-Centric Processes, \nscarce applications tried to minimize the environmental \nimpact of production processes through ML-PPC. In a \nworld where natural resources are becoming rare, this is \na non-negligible aspect that must be considered, not only \nbecause of the tightening of environmental laws by gov-\nernments but also because of the ethical responsibility of \ncompanies.\nCross\u2011axes analysis: mapping the\u00a0scientific literature \nthrough\u00a0use cases, I4.0 characteristics, and\u00a0learning \ntypes\nTo address the second objective of this study, a mapping \nof the scientific literature in ML-PPC is proposed. This is \nachieved through a cross-analysis employing the use cases, \ncharacteristics of I4.0, and learning types. Results are repre-\nsented via a cross-matrix having the use cases in the vertical \naxis and the characteristics of I4.0 in the horizontal axis. \nThis matrix also allows the maturity of a given use case to \nbe assessed. For instance, a mature use case in the scientific \nliterature will tend to satisfy more I4.0 characteristics. From \nthis point of view, the crossing between a characteristic of \nI4.0 and a use case will be referred as a domain.\nThe ID numbers defined on Table\u00a02 are employed to place \nthe analyzed articles in the matrix. Additionally, the learn-\ning types employed by each communication are represented \nusing a color code. Figure\u00a012 provides a summarized view of \nthis matrix, allowing for a high-level analysis that will help \nto identify research gaps and trends in ML-PPC.

The reason behind this could be that UL \ntechniques are normally used to perform data pre-process-\ning, as with Principal Component Analysis, or discovery of \nhidden patterns in datasets, e.g. with Clustering. There are \n6 papers using just UL, however, this learning type seems to \nunlock all of its potential when used in synergies, allowing \nfor the design of more complex models.\nEven if there are some SL-RL synergies, they are not \nvery common. This is probably because SL is normally \ncoupled with RL when there is a need of performing rapid \nestimations of functions to save computing time. However, it \nseems that most of the applications do not reach a scale that \nneeds this kind of configuration. Finally, it was found that \nusing UL-RL and SL-UL-RL is rare in the scientific litera-\nture. This does not mean that their synergy does not provide \nadvantages, it is just that there may not be a current need \nfor it. Also, it could be that coupling these learning types \nover-complexifies the model design, which prevents its use.\nConcerning the tools, only programming languages or \nsoftware used to implement the ML model were considered. \nTherefore, other tools such as discrete event simulation soft-\nware are out of the scope of this research. Results are pre-\nsented in Fig.\u00a09.\nFor clarity sake, tools being used only once were grouped \nin the category denominated as \u201cOthers\u201d. These tools were: \nACE Datamining System, C#, Clementine, GeNIe Modeler, \nHugin 8.1, NetLogo, Neural-SIM, Visual C++, and Xelopes \nLibrary. Additionally, it is important to mention that most \nof the researchers do not mention the tool the use to imple-\nment the models.\nIt could be said that MATLAB is, by far, the most used \ntool to perform ML-PPC in research. Besides its robust cal-\nculation capacity, the reason behind this could be that uni-\nversities often invest in licenses for this software; therefore, \nthey expect their researchers to use this tool. R is the second \nmost used tool, which may be because it is a free software \ntargeting statistical applications, including ML. Finally, the \nthird most used tools are both RapidMiner and Python. The \nformer eases the implementation of ML models thanks to \nits visual programming logic, while the latter is a multipur-\npose programming language recently characterized by its \nML libraries and frameworks such as Scikit-learn, PyToch, \nKeras, etc.\nThird research question: used data sources \nto\u00a0implement a\u00a0ML\u2011PPC\nTo answer this question, the data sources used by each of \nthe analyzed papers were identified. These results are sum-\nmarized in Table\u00a02. The column \u201cIdentification\u201d (ID) will \nassign a number to each communication. This will be used \nlater to establish a mapping of the scientific literature.\nResults show that \u201cArtificial data\u201d is the most used data \nsource in recent scientific literature. This probably highlights \nthe difficulty of accessing data coming from companies. \nAdditionally, it is important to remember the extensive use \nof RL techniques. These models normally require constant \naccess to data concerning the real-time status of the produc-\ntion system, which can be difficult to find in real factories. \nTherefore, researchers normally use Artificial or Public \ndata to test their models. This issue could be addressed by \ncreating digital twins, but this still represents a research \nchallenge.\nThe extensive use of artificial data suggests that there \nare data availability issues. This poses two main challenges: \nfirstly, dealing with highly unbalanced datasets when train-\ning, for instance, SL algorithms for classification, and sec-\nondly, accessing enough data to enable good generalization \ncapacity, especially in deep learning models.\nThe first challenge is common when training ML mod-\nels to identify disruptions. In fact, disruptive events in PPC \nsuch as machine breakdowns or quality problems tend to be \nscarce when compared to the total size of the dataset. Thus, \nML techniques struggle to learn these events. To tackle this \nissue, some authors have proposed solutions such as data \naugmentation, a common practice in computer vision that \nconsists of artificially creating new training examples by \nmodifying existent observations (Perez and Wang 2017; \nMiko\u0142ajczyk and Grochowski 2018). Another approach is \nto use crafted algorithms adapted to class-imbalance.

Con-\nsidering OUAs, it is surprising to find that only half of the \ncommunications used the CA, which corresponds to an \nactual implementation of the proposed model in the context \nof the study. This suggests that half of the studies go no \nfurther than just training and evaluating the performance \nof the model.\nMUAs group encompasses data pre-processing tasks, \nwhich are capital to any ML implementation. Even if these \nactivities are frequently employed in practice, their low \nusage is probably because researchers do not mention them, \nimplying a lack of documentation. Moreover, as one of the \ncharacteristics of big data is the variety (in type, nature, for-\nmat, etc.) (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2017), it is crucial to employ data \npre-processing activities to ensure the quality of the final \nmodels. Consequently, this lack of documentation can repre-\nsent a pitfall to practitioners willing to apply ML-PPC based \non research papers.\nFinally, SUAs cluster highlights the most important \nresearch gaps in scientific literature. Three key findings can \nbe inferred from activities in this group: firstly, the low usage \nof DA highlights the challenge of coupling IoT technolo-\ngies with ML-PPC. This is a major pitfall to deploy ML-\nPPC in companies, as they normally need real-time data or \nstatuses from their manufacturing systems. Secondly, the \nlack of DE utilization could mean that ML-PPC applica-\ntions tend to jump directly to activities in the CUAs cluster \nwhile overlooking descriptive and basic inferential statis-\ntics techniques. This represents an obstacle to generating \nknowledge from data, as DE can draw conclusions easily \ninterpretable by non-ML specialists. Finally, the rare use of \nMU implies that adapting the ML-PPC model to a dynamic \nmanufacturing context is seldom addressed. This unpredict-\nable change of the statistical properties and relationships \nbetween variables over time is known as concept drift (Ham-\nmami et\u00a0al. 2017). Not addressing this issue can be harmful \nfor the model reliability in the long term.\nSecond research question: techniques and\u00a0tools \nused in\u00a0ML\u2011PPC\nConcerning the techniques, results present the number of \ntimes a given ML model is used. In the case of communica-\ntions comparing several techniques, only the one chosen by \nthe authors because of its better performance was consid-\nered. If this best-performing model employs several tech-\nniques, each of them is counted as used once.\nThere are numerous ML techniques in scientific litera-\nture. Therefore, to ease the analysis of results, a grouping of \ntechniques in families is proposed is Table\u00a01. These families \nwere determined with the help of a ML expert. It is impor-\ntant to mention that the column \u201cConcerned techniques\u201d in \nTable\u00a01 is not an exhaustive list, it is limited to techniques \nfound in the systematic literature review.\nResults are presented in Fig.\u00a07. They suggest that NN, \nQ-Learning, and DT are the most used techniques in ML-\nPPC. The extensive use of NN is probably due to their abil-\nity to learn complex non-linear relationships between vari-\nables, often delivering good performance when compared \nto other techniques. Even if Q-Learning remains, by far, the \nmost used RL technique, other RL models such as Sarsa \nor R-Learning are used, which points an interest in agent-\nbased modeling in ML-PPC. Finally, the attention drawn by \nDT techniques is probably linked to their excellent trade-off \nbetween accuracy and interpretability, allowing knowledge \ngeneration.\nThe high use of Clustering techniques could be explained \nby the fact that data in manufacturing systems is normally \nunlabeled and can contain meaningful unknown patterns. \nTherefore, clustering can be employed to discover groups \nas well as hidden structures in datasets.\nThe usage evolution of the six most used technique fam-\nilies was also measured. Figures representing this can be \nfound in \u201cAppendix II\u201d. Due to an imbalance in the amount \nof articles over the different years, results are presented as \nrelative frequencies. For example, if the NN achieved a \nusage of 27% in 2018, it means that 27% of all the techniques \nused in that year corresponded to such a model. Results sug-\ngest that there is a strong growth in the use of NN since \n2015, this is possibly due to the growing computing power, \nrecent findings in terms of architectures such as CNNs or \nLSTMs, and the development of specialized frameworks like \nPyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. which ease the task of \nimplementing such models. Moreover, results show a grow-\ning interest on Ensemble learning techniques which evolved \nfrom not being used between 2011 and 2013 to accounting \nfor 14% of applications in 2018. This can possibly explain \nthe loss of interest on DT since 2017, as Random forests (a \ntype of Ensemble learning) can achieve better performance \nby using committees of decision trees.\n", []], "First research question: activities employed in\u00a0ML-PPC": ["1539\nJournal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1531\u20131558\t\n1 3\ninformation or measured data.

Thus, the MEM suits the \nfirst objective of this study, which concerns the definition \nof a methodology to implement a ML-PPC. There are five \nelements in the MEM:\n1.\t A procedure: order of activities to be followed when the \nmethod is employed.\n2.\t Techniques: the means to generate the results. Activities \nfrom the procedure are supported by techniques, while \nthe latter is supported by tools.\n3.\t Results: they correspond to the output of an activity.\n4.\t Role: the point of view adopted by the person who per-\nforms the activity and is responsible for it.\n5.\t Information model: this refers to the relation between \nthe first four mandatory elements.\nIn the scope of this study, the first two elements are the con-\ncern. Firstly, to evaluate the procedure, the activities used \nto perform a ML-PPC implementation will be recognized \nand their use will be measured. By activities, this research \nrefers to tasks such as \u201cmodel comparison and selection\u201d or \n\u201cdata cleaning\u201d. Secondly, to address the techniques, ML \nmodels and tools will be identified, and their use will be \nmeasured. ML models point to elements such as Support \nVector Machines or Neural Networks, while tools relate to \nprogramming languages or software used to implement these \nML models.\nTo provide further insight concerning the ML techniques, \nthe learning types will also be measured. This will be used to \nsummarize the information regarding the techniques as well \nas to ease the identification of trends and research perspec-\ntives. Additionally, the learning types will serve as a bridge \nbetween the first and second objectives of this study, as they \nwill be used in the mapping to classify scientific literature. \nBased on the work of Jordan and Mitchell (2015), three main \nlearning types can be identified:\n1.\t Supervised Learning (SL), which concerns ML tech-\nniques approximating a function f(X) = Y by learning \nthe relationship between the inputs X and the outputs \nY\u200a. For instance, learning the mapping between the Red \nGreen, and Blue (RGB) codes (input X\u200a) in an image \nand the objects in it (output Y\u200a) to determine if a certain \npicture contains a misplaced product in a stock rack.\n2.\t Unsupervised Learning (UL), which encompasses tech-\nniques allowing data exploration to find patterns and \nhidden structures in a given dataset X\u200a. For instance, \nfinding categories in maintenance reports by using the \ndescription of the problem and the duration of the main-\ntenance intervention.\n3.\t Reinforcement Learning (RL), which are techniques \nallowing the learning of actions to be performed by an \nagent interacting with a certain environment to maxi-\nmize a reward. For example, teaching an Automated \nGuided Vehicle (AGV) in a warehouse how to avoid \nobstacles to maximize the number of delivered pack-\nages.\nSecond axis of\u00a0the\u00a0analytical framework: employed \ndata sources\nThis axis addresses the third research question: the har-\nnessed data sources. Identifying which are the data sources \nused to perform a ML-PPC is capital. In fact, data could \nbe considered as the raw material allowing ML models to \ndevelop autonomous computer knowledge gain (Sharp et\u00a0al. \n2018). Moreover, the quality of the final model will depend \nto a great extent on the quality and appropriateness of the \nused data. Therefore, the choice of the data source is an \nimportant decision when training a ML model. To address \nthis axis of the analytical framework, the data source types \nproposed by Tao et\u00a0al. (2018) will be used.

Finally, (Sharp et\u00a0al. 2018) could \nbe considered as a study close to this paper as the authors \nused a pre-defined methodology to select the articles to ana-\nlyze. Nevertheless, they employed Natural Language Pro-\ncessing (NLP) to analyze around 4000 unique articles and \nprovide insights about the scientific literature of ML applied \nin I4.0. The use of NLP can be useful to identify important \ntrends, but it does not allow the authors to analyze the detail \nof the reviewed papers, where it is likely to find interesting \nresearch gaps and insights. On the other hand, a systematic \nreview allows the authors to both follow a rigorous method-\nology and perform a detailed study of each chosen article.\nEven though the PPC is closely related to the domain \nof supply chain, the latter is not included in the scope of \nthis review as its vastness would increase the risk of stray-\ning from the focus on PPC. Therefore, to learn about recent \ntrends on this topic, the authors invite readers to refer to \nHosseini et\u00a0al. (2019), who performed a comprehensive \nreview of quantitative methods, technologies, definitions, \nand key drivers of supply chain resilience. In fact, supply \nchain resilience is a growing research area that examines \nthe ability of a supply chain to respond to disruptive events \n(Hosseini et\u00a0al. 2019). Applications of this topic have been \ndone by Hosseini and Barker (2016), who applied Bayesian \nnetworks to perform supplier selection based on primary, \ngreen, and resilience criteria; and Hosseini and Ivanov \n(2019), who proposed a method using Bayesian networks to \nassess the resilience of suppliers in identifying critical links \nin a supply network.\nThe queries were performed between 10/10/2018 and \n24/03/2019 in two scientific databases: ScienceDirect and \nSCOPUS. The following keywords conducted the research:\n\u2022\t (\u201cDeep Learning\u201d OR \u201cMachine Learning\u201d) AND (\u201cPro-\nduction scheduling\u201d)\n\u2022\t (\u201cDeep Learning\u201d OR \u201cMachine Learning\u201d) AND (\u201cPro-\nduction planning\u201d)\n\u2022\t (\u201cDeep Learning\u201d OR \u201cMachine Learning\u201d) AND (\u201cPro-\nduction control\u201d)\n\u2022\t (\u201cDeep Learning\u201d OR \u201cMachine Learning\u201d) AND (\u201cLine \nbalancing\u201d)\nTo consider the context of I4.0, only papers published since \n2011 were considered because this year corresponds to the \nformal introduction of I4.0 at the Hannover Fair.

Subsequently, a review of titles and \nabstracts allowed for the exclusion of articles not related to \nML-PPC. After the removal of duplicates, a full text analysis \nallowed a final selection that excluded papers that did not fit \nwith research questions. The sample size obtained encom-\npasses 93 scientific papers. The article selection methodol-\nogy with its Restrictions (R) is described in Fig.\u00a01.\nA brief focus on\u00a0the\u00a0query keywords\nThe used string chains represent a core strategic choice for \nreview. Therefore, this sub section aims to provide an analy-\nsis of the employed keywords.\nConcerning the keywords used in the first parenthesis of \nthe string chains, the use of \u201cDeep Learning\u201d and \u201cMachine \nLearning\u201d was done for two reasons: firstly, they are rela-\ntively new terms, which eases the identification of recent \ntrends in the literature; and secondly, they are directly related \nto one of the two core subjects in this study, which is ML. \nOther terms such as \u201cData Mining\u201d or \u201cStatistical Learn-\ning\u201d could have been sensible choices too, as they are often \nused interchangeably with \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cDeep \nLearning\u201d. Nevertheless, using these two terms might have \ndeviated this study from its core topic. In fact, a recent study \nsuggests that the differences between ML and Data Min-\ning are not consistently defined in the literature. Thus, Data \nMining is mostly considered to be the process of generat-\ning useful knowledge from data (Schuh et\u00a0al. 2019). To do \nso, it draws from other fields such as Artificial Intelligence, \nStatistics, ML, and Data Analytics. Therefore, Data Mining \ncan be a vast topic, and does not exclusively concern ML, \nwhich could potentially affect the focus of this study. As \nthere seems to be no clear boundary between these terms, \na short bibliometric analysis was performed to assess the \nchosen keywords. The analysis was done using VOSviewer, \nsoftware developed by the University of Leiden to draw \ninsights from scientific literature. Furthermore, using key-\nwords related to specific ML techniques such as \u201cRandom \nForest\u201d or \u201ck-means\u201d did not seem appropriate due to \nthe risk of introducing a bias when answering the second \nresearch question. In fact, this could have artificially boosted \nthe results of the queried techniques.\nThe bibliometric analysis followed a similar methodology \nto that used to choose the final article sample (cf. Fig.\u00a01). \nThe objective was to briefly assess the influence of differ-\nent keywords on the queries\u2019 results. For the analysis, three \ndifferent string chains were considered: \u201cDeep Learning\u201d \nOR \u201cMachine Learning\u201d, \u201cData Mining\u201d, and \u201cStatistical \nLearning\u201d. The queries were performed on 06/10/2019 and \nthe detail of the search strategy can be found in \u201cAppendix \nI\u201d. Finally, as the aim is to analyze the available literature \nwhen querying with a certain string chain, no Title and \nabstract review was done as this could introduce a bias into \nthe results due to the authors\u2019 influence.\nThe bibliometric analysis focused on the keywords \ndefined by the authors for all of the papers of each of \nthe three samples. To represent the results, the network \n", [55, 63, 64, 72]], "Research methodology and\u00a0contribution": ["1532\n\t\nJournal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1531\u20131558\n1 3\nfor example in the European Union around \u20ac7 billion will be \ninvested by 2020 in Factories of the Future (Kusiak 2017).\nAmong the Industry 4.0 groups of technologies (Ruess-\nmann et\u00a0al. 2015), Big Data and Analytics (BDA) allows the \nconstantly growing mass of produced data to be harnessed \nto generate added value. In fact, data generation in modern \nmanufacturing has undergone explosive growth, reaching \naround 1000 Exabytes per year (Tao et\u00a0al. 2018). However, \nthe potential of this data has been found to be insufficiently \nexploited by companies (Manns et\u00a0al. 2015; Moeuf et\u00a0al. \n2018). As BDA enables the exploitation of data, the scope \nof this review will focus on this technology, and more spe-\ncifically ML applied in Production Planning and Control.\nIn the context of I4.0, Production Planning and Control \n(PPC) can be defined as the function determining the global \nquantities to be produced (production plan) to satisfy the \ncommercial plan and to meet the profitability, productivity \nand delivery time objectives. It also encompasses the con-\ntrol of production process, allowing real-time synchroniza-\ntion of resources as well as product customization (Tony \nArnold et\u00a0al. 2012; Moeuf et\u00a0al. 2018). In this review, I4.0 \nis considered a synonym of Smart Manufacturing, as they \nboth refer to technological advances that value data to draw \nimprovements in production. For example, Ruessmann et\u00a0al. \n(2015) proposed nine technologies for I4.0 while Kusiak \n(2019) suggested six, but for Smart Manufacturing. Both \nproposals tend to refer to similar technologies and variations \ndepend on the authors\u2019 focus. Hence, as the PPC is a core \nfunction of manufacturing, this paper regards its improve-\nment through I4.0 technologies, namely ML, which concerns \nBDA. Regarding ML, the definition that will be retained is \nthe one of a computer program capable of learning from \nexperience to improve a performance measure at a given \ntask (Mitchell 1997).\nClassical approaches to performing PPC include analyti-\ncal methods and precise simulations, providing solutions that \nmay rapidly become unfeasible in the execution phase due to \nthe stochastic nature of the production system and uncertain-\nties such as machine breakdowns, scrap rate, delayed deliv-\neries, etc. Moreover, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) \nsystems perform poorly at the operative level (Gyulai et\u00a0al. \n2015). To tackle this issue, ML can endow the PPC with \nthe capacity of learning from historical or real-time data to \nreact to predictable and unpredictable events. Even though \nthis may suggest that organizations must invest in data ware-\nhousing to handle the mass amount of collected data, stud-\nies have reported that enterprises successfully implementing \ndata-driven solutions have experienced a payback of 10\u201370 \ntimes their investment in data warehousing (Rainer 2013).\nHaving introduced the synergism between ML and PPC, \nthis study aims to provide an analysis of its state-of-the-art \nthrough a systematic literature review. This will contribute \nto the definition of a methodology to implement a ML-PPC \nand to the proposal of a map to classify scientific literature. \nThis paper analyzes research produced in the context of the \nI4.0 and is guided by five research questions:\n1.\t Which are the activities employed to perform a ML-\nPPC?\n2.\t Which are the techniques and tools used to implement a \nML-PPC?\n3.\t Which are the currently harnessed data sources to imple-\nment a ML-PPC?\n4.\t Which are the addressed use cases by the recent scien-\ntific literature in ML-PPC?\n5.\t Which are the characteristics of the I4.0 targeted by the \nrecent scientific literature in ML-PPC?\nThe first three questions are related to the first objective \nof this research. They will contribute to the definition of a \nmethodology to implement a ML-PPC. The last two ques-\ntions address the second objective, as they will provide the \nbasis to create a classification map.\nThe reminder of this paper is organized as follows: sec-\ntion \u201cResearch methodology and contribution\u201d will explain \nthe systematic literature review methodology employed to \nsearch and choose the sample of scientific articles. Addition-\nally, the contribution of this paper with respect to similar \nstudies will be briefly highlighted and a short bibliometric \nanalysis is presented to assess the keywords used as string \nchains. The \u201cAnalytical framework\u201d section will explain the \nfour axes encompassed by the analytical framework. After-\nwards, the \u201cResults\u201d section will focus on the results of the \nsystematic literature review and an analysis of it. Finally, \nthe \u201cConclusion and further research perspectives\u201d sec-\ntion will conclude this study and provide further research \nperspectives.\nResearch methodology and\u00a0contribution\nTo meet the two objectives of this study, a systematic litera-\nture review was carried out following the method proposed \nby Tranfield et\u00a0al. (2003) who extended research methods \nfrom the medical sector to the management sciences. This \nmethod has been successfully employed by other authors to \ndraw insights from the scientific literature (Garengo et\u00a0al. \n2005; Moeuf et\u00a0al. 2018).

With the advent of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0), copious availability \nof data, high-computing power and large storage capacity have made of Machine Learning (ML) approaches an appealing \nsolution to tackle manufacturing challenges. As such, this paper presents a state-of-the-art of ML-aided PPC (ML-PPC) \ndone through a systematic literature review analyzing 93 recent research application articles. This study has two main objec-\ntives: contribute to the definition of a methodology to implement ML-PPC and propose a mapping to classify the scientific \nliterature to identify further research perspectives. To achieve the first objective, ML techniques, tools, activities, and data \nsources which are required to implement a ML-PPC are reviewed. The second objective is developed through the analysis of \nthe use cases and the addressed characteristics of the I4.0. Results suggest that 75% of the possible research domains in ML-\nPPC are barely explored or not addressed at all. This lack of research originates from two possible causes: firstly, scientific \nliterature rarely considers customer, environmental, and human-in-the-loop aspects when linking ML to PPC. Secondly, \nrecent applications seldom couple PPC to logistics as well as to design of products and processes. Finally, two key pitfalls \nare identified in the implementation of ML-PPC models: the complexity of using Internet of Things technologies to collect \ndata and the difficulty of updating the ML model to adapt it to the manufacturing system changes.\nKeywords\u2002 Machine learning\u00a0\u00b7 Industry 4.0\u00a0\u00b7 Smart manufacturing\u00a0\u00b7 Production planning and control\u00a0\u00b7 State-of-the-art\u00a0\u00b7 \nSystematic literature review\nIntroduction\nThe current manufacturing environment is characterized \nby high complexity, dynamic production conditions and \nvolatile markets. Additionally, companies must offer cus-\ntomized products while engaging low costs and reducing \nthe time-to-market if they want to remain competitive in a \nglobalized world (Schuh et\u00a0al. 2017b; Carvajal Soto et\u00a0al. \n2019). This situation poses tremendous challenges for \nmanufacturers who seek to implement new technologies \nto meet their objectives while expecting a return on invest-\nment. Several countries have developed projects that aim \nto help companies adapt their industries to new production \ntechnologies. For instance, Germany created Industry 4.0 \n(I4.0), the United States proposed the Smart Manufacturing \nLeadership Coalition, and China introduced the plan called \nChina Manufacturing 2025 (Wang et\u00a0al. 2018a).

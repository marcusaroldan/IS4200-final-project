    <title>Best algorithms for time-series forecasting in machine learning</title>
    <description>What are the best machine learning algorithms for time-series forecasting and how do they perform on different types of time-series data?</description>
    <narrative>Relevant documents should include detailed descriptions of machine learning algorithms specifically designed for time-series forecasting. Relevant content includes information on algorithms such as ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and other methods used to handle time-dependent data. Examples of their performance on various datasets, including comparisons between algorithms, strengths, weaknesses, and specific use cases for different types of time-series data (e.g., financial, medical, sensor data), are highly relevant. Irrelevant documents include general machine learning discussions that do not focus on time-series applications.</narrative>

            <text>The choice of the most promising algorithm to model and predict a particular phenomenon is one of the most prominent activities of the temporal data forecasting. Forecasting (or prediction), similarly to other data mining tasks, uses empirical evidence to select the most suitable model for a problem at hand since no modeling method can be considered as the best. However, according to our systematic literature review of the last decade, few scientific publications rigorously expose the benefits and limitations of the most popular algorithms for time series prediction. At the same time, there is a limited performance record of these models when applied to complex and highly nonlinear data. In this paper, we present one of the most extensive, impartial and comprehensible experimental evaluations ever done in the time series prediction field. From 95 datasets, we evaluate eleven predictors, seven parametric and four non-parametric, employing two multi-step-ahead projection strategies and four performance evaluation measures. We report many lessons learned and recommendations concerning the advantages, drawbacks, and the best conditions for the use of each model. The results show that SARIMA is the only statistical method able to outperform, but without a statistical difference, the following machine learning algorithms: ANN, SVM, and kNN-TSPI. However, such forecasting accuracy comes at the expense of a larger number of parameters. The evaluated datasets, as well detailed results achieved by different indexes as MSE, Theil’s U coefficient, POCID, and a recently-proposed multi-criteria performance measure are available online in our repository. Such repository is another contribution of this paper since other researchers can replicate our results and evaluate their methods more rigorously. The findings of this study will impact further research on this topic since they provide a broad insight into models selection, parameters setting, evaluation measures, and experimental setup.<text>

            <text>Rainfall forecasting has gained utmost research relevance in recent times due to its complexities and persistent applications such as flood forecasting and monitoring of pollutant concentration levels, among others. Existing models use complex statistical models that are often too costly, both computationally and budgetary, or are not applied to downstream applications. Therefore, approaches that use Machine Learning algorithms in conjunction with time-series data are being explored as an alternative to overcome these drawbacks. To this end, this study presents a comparative analysis using simplified rainfall estimation models based on conventional Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures that are efficient for these downstream applications. Models based on LSTM, Stacked-LSTM, Bidirectional-LSTM Networks, XGBoost, and an ensemble of Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Support Vector Regression, and an Extra-trees Regressor were compared in the task of forecasting hourly rainfall volumes using time-series data. Climate data from 2000 to 2020 from five major cities in the United Kingdom were used. The evaluation metrics of Loss, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error were used to evaluate the models’ performance. Results show that a Bidirectional-LSTM Network can be used as a rainfall forecast model with comparable performance to Stacked-LSTM Networks. Among all the models tested, the Stacked-LSTM Network with two hidden layers and the Bidirectional-LSTM Network performed best. This suggests that models based on LSTM-Networks with fewer hidden layers perform better for this approach; denoting its ability to be applied as an approach for budget-wise rainfall forecast applications.</text>

            <text>In this work we present a large scale comparison study for the major machine learning models for time series forecasting. Specifically, we apply the models on the monthly M3 time series competition data (around a thousand time series). There have been very few, if any, large scale comparison studies for machine learning models for the regression or the time series forecasting problems, so we hope this study would fill this gap. The models considered are multilayer perceptron, Bayesian neural networks, radial basis functions, generalized regression neural networks (also called kernel regression), K-nearest neighbor regression, CART regression trees, support vector regression, and Gaussian processes. The study reveals significant differences between the different methods. The best two methods turned out to be the multilayer perceptron and the Gaussian process regression. In addition to model comparisons, we have tested different preprocessing methods and have shown that they have different impacts on the performance.</text>

    <title>Techniques for natural language understanding in conversational AI systems</title>
    <description>What are the key techniques for natural language understanding (NLU) in conversational AI systems, and how do they impact system performance?</description>
    <narrative>Relevant documents must provide a deep dive into various techniques used in natural language understanding for conversational AI systems. This includes information on tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and the use of deep learning models such as BERT, GPT, or transformer-based architectures for NLU. Information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the effectiveness of these techniques in real-world conversational systems, including examples of implementations in chatbots or virtual assistants, is essential.

                <text>Conversational interfaces recently gained a lot of attention. One of the reasons for the current hype is the fact that chatbots (one particularly popular form of conversational interfaces) nowadays can be created without any programming knowledge, thanks to different toolkits and so-called Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services. While these NLU services are already widely used in both, industry and science, so far, they have not been analysed systematically. In this paper, we present a method to evaluate the classification performance of NLU services. Moreover, we present two new corpora, one consisting of annotated questions and one consisting of annotated questions with the corresponding answers. Based on these corpora, we conduct an evaluation of some of the most popular NLU services. Thereby we want to enable both, researchers and companies to make more educated decisions about which service they should use.</text>

                <text>This paper aims to provide a thorough exploration of the current challenges involved in scaling machine learning algorithms to meet the demands of Big Data analytics. We examine the computational and algorithmic limitations of conventional ML models when applied to large-scale datasets, focusing on issues like data distribution, processing power, memory consumption, and the need for real-time decision-making. Additionally, we explore emerging approaches, such as parallel and distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Apache Spark), cloud-based solutions, federated learning, and hybrid models, which aim to enhance the scalability of ML algorithms. By leveraging these advancements, organizations can reduce training times, minimize resource consumption, and deliver real-time insights more effectively.</text>

                <text>Big data analytics is one of the emerging technologies as it promises to provide better insights from huge and heterogeneous data. Big data analytics involves selecting the suitable big data storage and computational framework augmented by scalable machine-learning algorithms. Despite the tremendous buzz around big data analytics and its advantages, an extensive literature survey focused on parallel data-intensive machine-learning algorithms for big data has not been conducted so far. The present paper provides a comprehensive overview of various machine-learning algorithms used in big data analytics. The present work is an attempt to identify the gaps in the work already performed by researchers, thus paving the way for further quality research in parallel scalable algorithms for big data.</text>

                <text>This work describes a proposal for developing and testing a scalable machine learning architecture able to provide real-time predictions or analytics as a service over domain-independent big data, working on top of the Hadoop ecosystem and providing real-time analytics as a service through a RESTful API. Systems implementing this architecture could provide companies with on-demand tools facilitating the tasks of storing, analyzing, understanding and reacting to their data, either in batch or stream fashion; and could turn into a valuable asset for improving the business performance and be a key market differentiator in this fast pace environment. In order to validate the proposed architecture, two systems are developed, each one providing classical machine-learning services in different domains: the first one involves a recommender system for web advertising, while the second consists in a prediction system which learns from gamers' behavior and tries to predict future events such as purchases or churning. An evaluation is carried out on these systems, and results show how both services are able to provide fast responses even when a number of concurrent requests are made, and in the particular case of the second system, results clearly prove that computed predictions significantly outperform those obtained if random guess was used.</text>

    <title>Best practices for model interpretability in AI research</title>
    <description>What are the best practices for ensuring the interpretability of AI models, and why is interpretability important in AI research?</description>
    <narrative>Relevant documents should discuss techniques and frameworks for improving the interpretability of machine learning models, such as SHAP, LIME, and attention mechanisms. The document should explain why interpretability is crucial for model transparency, fairness, and accountability, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, or criminal justice. Documents that provide case studies or evaluations of interpretability in deployed systems, along with discussions on trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability, are highly relevant. Irrelevant documents would be those that do not discuss model interpretability techniques or focus solely on the technical performance of AI models without addressing transparency.</narrative>

                <text>Learning methods such as boosting and deep learning have made ML models harder to understand and interpret. This puts data scientists and ML developers in the position of often having to make a tradeoff between accuracy and intelligibility. Research in IML (Interpretable Machine Learning) and XAI (Explainable AI) focus on minimizing this trade-off by developing more accurate interpretable models and by developing new techniques to explain black-box models. Such models and techniques make it easier for data scientists, engineers and model users to debug models and achieve important objectives such as ensuring the fairness of ML decisions and the reliability and safety of AI systems. In this tutorial, we present an overview of various interpretability methods and provide a framework for thinking about how to choose the right explanation method for different real-world scenarios. We will focus on the application of XAI in practice through a variety of case studies from domains such as healthcare, finance, and bias and fairness. Finally, we will present open problems and research directions for the data mining and machine learning community. What audience will learn: When and how to use a variety of machine learning interpretability methods through case studies of real-world situations. The difference between glass-box and black-box explanation methods and when to use them. How to use open source interpretability toolkits that are now available</text>

                <text>As the use of machine learning (ML) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. While scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like HCI, ML, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. This lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. To bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. Based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ML models. The characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. We present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.</text>

                <text>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into “black box” approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.</text>

    <title>Ethical guidelines for AI system development in healthcare applications</title>
    <description>What are the ethical guidelines for developing AI systems in healthcare, and how do they address issues like fairness, privacy, and accountability?</description>
    <narrative>Relevant documents should provide ethical frameworks or guidelines specifically for developing AI systems in the healthcare sector. This includes guidelines related to data privacy (e.g., HIPAA compliance), fairness in algorithmic decision-making, and the potential societal impacts of AI in healthcare (e.g., bias, access to care, or patient safety). The documents should cover both the regulatory and practical aspects of implementing these guidelines in real-world healthcare AI systems.

                <text>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in variety of areas has encouraged an extensive global discourse on the underlying ethical principles and values. With the rapid AI development process and its near instant global coverage, the issues of applicable ethical principles and guidelines have become vital. AI promises to deliver a lot of advantages to economic, social and educational fields. Since AI is also increasingly applied in healthcare and medical education areas, ethical application issues are growing ever more important. Ethical and social issues raised by AI in healthcare overlap with those raised by personal data use, function automation, reliance on assistive medical technologies and the so-called â€˜telehealthâ€™. Without well-grounded ethical guidelines or even regulatory framework in respect of the AI in healthcare several legal and ethical problems at the implementational level can arise. In order to facilitate further discussion about the ethical principles and responsibilities of educational system in healthcare using AI and to potentially arrive at a consensus concerning safe and desirable uses of AI in healthcare education, this paper performs an evaluation of the self-imposed AI ethical guidelines identifying the common principles and approaches as well as drawbacks limiting the practical and legal application of internal policies. The main aim of the research is to encourage integration of theoretical studies and policy studies on sustainability issues in correlation between healthcare and technologies, the AI ethical perspective.</text>

                <text>As the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving aspects of healthcare delivery is increasingly becoming evident, it becomes likely that AI will be incorporated in routine clinical care in the near future. This promise has led to growing focus and investment in AI medical applications both from governmental organizations and technological companies. However, concern has been expressed about the ethical and regulatory aspects of the application of AI in health care. These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care. In this article, we propose a governance model that aims to not only address the ethical and regulatory issues that arise out of the application of AI in health care, but also stimulate further discussion about governance of AI in health care.</text>

                <text>A number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks have been published in the last 6 years in response to the growing concerns posed by the adoption of AI in different sectors, including healthcare. While there is a strong culture of medical ethics in healthcare applications, AI-based Healthcare Applications (AIHA) are challenging the existing ethics and regulatory frameworks. This scoping review explores how ethics frameworks have been implemented in AIHA, how these implementations have been evaluated and whether they have been successful. AI specific ethics frameworks in healthcare appear to have a limited adoption and they are mostly used in conjunction with other ethics frameworks. The operationalisation of ethics frameworks is a complex endeavour with challenges at different levels: ethics principles, design, technology, organisational, and regulatory. Strategies identified in this review are proactive, contextual, technological, checklist, organisational and/or evidence-based approaches. While interdisciplinary approaches show promises, how an ethics framework is implemented in an AI-based Healthcare Application is not widely reported, and there is a need for transparency for trustworthy AI.</text>

                <text>Because search space in artificial neural networks (ANNs) is high dimensional and multimodal which is usually polluted by noises and missing data, the process of weight training is a complex continuous optimization problem. This paper deals with the application of a recently invented metaheuristic optimization algorithm, bird mating optimizer (BMO), for training feed-forward ANNs. BMO is a population-based search method which tries to imitate the mating ways of bird species for designing optimum searching techniques. In order to study the usefulness of the proposed algorithm, BMO is applied to weight training of ANNs for solving three real-world classification problems, namely, Iris flower, Wisconsin breast cancer, and Pima Indian diabetes. The performance of BMO is compared with those of the other classifiers. Simulation results indicate the superior capability of BMO to tackle the problem of ANN weight training. BMO is also applied to model fuel cell system which has been addressed as an open and demanding problem in electrical engineering. The promising results verify the potential of BMO algorithm.</text>

                <text>Ant colony optimization (ACO) is an optimization technique that was inspired by the foraging behaviour of real ant colonies. Originally, the method was introduced for the application to discrete optimization problems. Recently we proposed a first ACO variant for continuous optimization. In this work we choose the training of feed-forward neural networks for pattern classification as a test case for this algorithm. In addition, we propose hybrid algorithm variants that incorporate short runs of classical gradient techniques such as backpropagation. For evaluating our algorithms we apply them to classification problems from the medical field, and compare the results to some basic algorithms from the literature. The results show, first, that the best of our algorithms are comparable to gradient-based algorithms for neural network training, and second, that our algorithms compare favorably with a basic genetic algorithm.</text>

                <text>Feed-forward neural networks are commonly used for pattern classification. The classification accuracy of feed-forward neural networks depends on the configuration selected and the training process. Once the architecture of the network is decided, training algorithms, usually gradient descent techniques, are used to determine the connection weights of the feed-forward neural network. However, gradient descent techniques often get trapped in local optima of the search landscape. To address this issue, an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is applied to train feed-forward neural networks for pattern classification in this paper. In addition, the ACO training algorithm is hybridized with gradient descent training. Both standalone and hybrid ACO training algorithms are evaluated on several benchmark pattern classification problems, and compared with other swarm intelligence, evolutionary and traditional training algorithms. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed ACO training algorithms for feed-forward neural networks for pattern classification.</text>

    <title>Evaluation methods for machine learning models in production environments</title>
    <description>What are the best methods for evaluating machine learning models once they are deployed in production, and how do these methods ensure continuous model performance?</description>
    <narrative>Relevant documents should explain methods for monitoring and evaluating machine learning models in production environments, such as A/B testing, performance tracking, drift detection, and model retraining techniques. Documents should also cover evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and domain-specific metrics. Information on how to handle issues like concept drift or data distribution shifts in deployed models is highly relevant. Irrelevant documents would focus only on theoretical aspects of model evaluation or discuss evaluation in a development or training environment rather than in production.</narrative>

                <text>This research explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in testing automation, focusing on its ability to enhance test coverage and enable predictive analysis for improved software quality. As software systems become increasingly complex, traditional testing methods often struggle to meet quality demands. This study evaluates various AI techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing, and their applications in generating test cases, optimizing testing processes, and predicting defects. Through empirical case studies from diverse organizations, we demonstrate significant improvements in test coverage and defect detection rates following AI implementation. The findings highlight the efficiency gains and quality enhancements achieved through AI-driven testing, while also addressing challenges such as data dependency, complexity of implementation, and the need for skilled personnel. This research contributes to the understanding of AI's role in software testing and encourages organizations to adopt these technologies for better quality assurance and faster development cycles. </text>
